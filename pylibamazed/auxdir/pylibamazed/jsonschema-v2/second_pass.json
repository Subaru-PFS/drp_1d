NOTE: thus the continuum model is not redshifted at the redshift fitted by the lines \n * **retryall**: redo all the continuum estimation on the fine grid then select the best continuum and its parameters (including redshift) and fit the remaining with the line model by scanning again the z fine grid (be carefull to set the continuumfitcount parameter to 1) \n * **refitfirstpass**: use the continuum from firstPass, redshift it by adapting the amplitude. Template, ism and igm coeff remain intact. \n\nIf we are in the case of templateFitting second pass, only refitfirstpass option is possible."
